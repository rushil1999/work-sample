# work-sample
A work sample to demonstrate my grasp on Microservices, Kafka, Node Typescript, GraphQL, gRPC, and fundamental understanding of system design

## Key Points
* I have removed all the configs, important links, imports, etc. Just kept the structure and some functions that are enough to fulfill the purpose of this repository
* There are two folders in this repository
  * Micro-service folder has a Model, Controller, Service architecture
  * The Kafka service is to demonstrate the event-driven consumer architecture
