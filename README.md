# work-sample
A work sample to demonstrate my grasp on Microservices, Kafka, Node Typescript, GraphQL, gRPC, and fundamental understanding of system design

## Key Points
* I have removed all the configs, important links, imports, etc. Just kept the structure and some functions that are enough to fulfill the purpose of this repository
* There are two folders in this repository
  * Micro-service folder has a Model, Controller, Service architecture
  * The Kafka service is to demonstrate the event-driven consumer architecture
 
 ## Microservice
 * This work sample has a production-ready project structure that has Controllers, models, services, and other general files. The code base has efficient logging and error handling functionality and is written in strictly typed language to prevent bugs at the production level


## Kafka-Service
* This service is a Kafka consumer implementation, used to provide real-time sorting of NoSQL documents, based on client requirements. The service is made scalable and has batch processing to reduce the overall latency of the operations
